          Problems:<br>
          -Lack of time during development.<br>
          -Issues with GitHub when putting our work together.<br>
          -Managing team work so that everyone has equal(ish) amount of work<br>
          -And that everyone knows what they are supposed to do (and how since there is 2 game managers in the game)<br><br>
          What Did I Learn:<br>
          -Working in a hurry.<br>
          -That GitHub is dumb.<br>
          -Working with GitHub in a way that our project doesnt break everytime we put our work together.<br>
          -Managing the teams working schedule.<br>
          -And ofcourse teamwork with my other project members.<br></p>

        <h2>About games Offline Progress</h2>
        <p>Here you can see the code for the offline progress in the game made by me. I think it is a really nice feature in the game even though not a necessary one. I remember fighting with it for quite a long time until i finally got it to work.<br>
           The mechanic basically starts counting time after the user has left the game and remembers it until the player returns. While the player is not playing the player still gets progress towards their relative material gains. </p>
